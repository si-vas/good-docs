Sync Jenkins Workspace with 2 different servers (Active and Passive)
(Works with Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 16.04)

Install NFS to mount.
apt install -y nfs-common

adding DNS to sync workspace using AWS EFS
aws EFS DNS name    fs-fa0cc77a.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /var/lib/jenkins nfs defaults 0 0
copy this in 2 servers in /etc/fstab
mount -a         -> it will mount in diskspace

JENKINS HIGH-AVAILIBILITY:

Create a user and login with that user and create the token which can be used to reload the config rather than restart the server. Username used for this example is reloadconfig

Make sure you have restarted the secondary jenkins service so that the user is visible to secondary.

Download the jenkins-cli in /var/lib/jenkins
wget http://<<ip>>:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar

Using the token genarated from user create a cronjob to run every minute so that without restarting service Jobs will sync with 2 servers

java -jar /jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<ip>:8080 -auth reloadconfig:11753e581628002506468ce3e44a8a1076 reload-configuration
